        "title": "An exploratory analysis of security on data transmission on relevant software engineering discussion sites",
        "description": "The Question and Answer (Q&A) sites are very popular nowadays for discussion on technological issues. Among the most prominent topics of these sites, posts related to security are widely visited. Security discussions may be classified broadly into two categories: application and infrastructure security. In this research, we studied several community Q&A sites to analyze the characteristics of requirements and difficulties to implement security in data transmission, one of the most dominant topics of infrastructure security. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of this kind. Our findings are expected to make it easier for the interested people to acquire knowledge about recent threats and security issues of data transmission in a methodical way and also to understand the trends of relevant technologies. We found that Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the most discussed technique over the years and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack is the primary concern for the developers.",

        "title": "Mitigating information disclosure attacks in the cloud by blocking invalid user and figure out problems to solve ddos by analyzing stackoverflow questions",
        "description": "According to the A10 Networks survey, in 2017 the DDoS of Things (DoT) has reached critical mass in each attack. And the rise of DDoS attacks on cloud computing is commonplace. In this paper, we review and analyze different existing DDoS detecting techniques against different parameters, and propose a new composite architecture to protect AWS infrastructure. The proposed work provides prevention against the DDoS attack on SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) based web services. Our proposed framework check the authenticity of the user, who want to access the data, which is available on the cloud server. And one more thing we reveal in this research that what are the problems facing by the developer and AWS user by the questions they asked recently in Stackoverflow site.",
